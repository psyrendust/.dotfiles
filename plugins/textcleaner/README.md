NAME: TEXTCLEANER

PURPOSE: To process a scanned document of text to clean the text background.

DESCRIPTION: TEXTCLEANER processses a scanned document of text to clean
the text background and enhance the text. The order of processing is:
1) optional 90 degree rotate if aspect does not match layout
2) optional crop,
3) optional convert to grayscale,
4) optional enhance,
5) filter to clean background and optionally smooth/antialias,
6) optional unrotate (limited to about 5 degrees or less),
7) optional text smoothing,
8) optional sharpening,
9) optional saturation change (if -g is not specified),
10) optional alternate text smoothing via adaptive blur
11) optional auto trim of border (effective only if background well-cleaned),
12) optional pad of border

OPTIONS:

-r rotate ... ROTATE image either clockwise or counterclockwise by 90 degrees,
if image aspect ratio does not match the layout mode. Choices are: cc (or
clockwise), ccw (or counterclockwise) and n (or none). The default is no rotation.

-l layout ... LAYOUT for determining if rotation is to be applied. The choices
are p (or portrait) or l (or landscape). The image will be rotated if rotate is
specified and the aspect ratio of the image does not match the layout chosen.
The default is portrait.

-c cropoffsets ... CROPOFFSETS are the image cropping offsets after potential
rotate 90. Choices: one, two or four non-negative integer comma separated
values. One value will crop all around. Two values will crop at
left/right,top/bottom. Four values will crop left,top,right,bottom.

-g ... Convert the document to grayscale.

-e enhance ... ENHANCE brightness of image. The choices are: none, stretch,
or normalize. The default=stretch.

-f filtersize ... FILTERSIZE is the size of the filter used to clean up the
background. Values are integers>0. The filtersize needs to be larger than
the thickness of the writing, but the smaller the better beyond this. Making it
larger will increase the processing time and may lose text. The default is 15.

-o offset ... OFFSET is the offset threshold in percent used by the filter
to eliminate noise. Values are integers>=0. Values too small will leave much
noise and artifacts in the result. Values too large will remove too much
text leaving gaps. The default is 5.

-u ... UNROTATE the image. This is limited to about 5 degrees or less.

-t threshold ... THRESHOLD is the text smoothing threshold. Values are integers
between 0 and 100. Smaller values smooth/thicken the text more. Larger values
thin, but can result in gaps in the text. Nominal value is in the middle at
about 50. The default is to disable smoothing.

-s sharpamt ... SHARPAMT is the amount of pixel sharpening to be applied to
the resulting text. Values are floats>=0. If used, it should be small
(suggested about 1). The default=0 (no sharpening).

-S saturation ... SATURATION is the desired color saturation of the text
expressed as a percentage. Values are integers>=0. A value of 100 is no change.
Larger values will make the text colors more saturated. The default=200
indicates double saturation. Not applicable when -g option specified.

-a adaptblur ... ADAPTBLUR applies an alternate text smoothing using
an adaptive blur. The values are floats>=0. The default=0 indicates no
blurring.

-T ... TRIM the border around the image.

-p padamt ... PADAMT is the border pad amount in pixels. The default=0.

-b bgcolor ... BGCOLOR is the desired background color after it has been
cleaned up. Any valid IM color may be use. The default is white.

CAVEAT: No guarantee that this script will work on all platforms,
nor that trapping of inconsistent parameters is complete and
foolproof. Use At Your Own Risk.
